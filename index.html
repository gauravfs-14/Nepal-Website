		<h2>Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal</h2>
		<p>Nepal (Nepali: नेपाल [neˈpal]), officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a country in South
			Asia. It is mainly in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It is the 49th
			largest country by population and 93rd largest country by area. It is landlocked, and borders China in the
			north and India in the south, east and west, while Bangladesh is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its
			southeastern tip and Bhutan is separated from it by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse
			geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest
			mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the capital and the largest
			city. Nepal is a multiethnic country with Nepali as the official language.

			The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the era in
			ancient India when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. In the middle of the first
			millennium BCE, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of
			northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet. The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is
			intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as
			Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley's traders. The
			cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture. By the 18th century, the Gorkha
			Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later
			formed an alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. The country was never
			colonized but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India. Parliamentary democracy was
			introduced in 1951, but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese Civil War
			in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular republic in 2008, ending the world's
			last Hindu monarchy.

			The Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms Nepal as a secular federal parliamentary republic
			divided into seven provinces. Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and friendship treaties were
			signed with India in 1950 and the People's Republic of China in 1960. Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat
			of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), of which it is a founding member. Nepal is
			also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bay of Bengal Initiative. The military of Nepal is the
			fifth largest in South Asia; it is notable for its Gurkha history, particularly during the world wars, and
			has been a significant contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations. </p>
